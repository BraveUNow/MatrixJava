# MatrixJava
personal project using java array to implement some matrix operations

The project was mainly used for exercises and was not considered to improve computational efficiency. In the project I created a class named Matrix, where all of the operations is based on a two-dimensional double array in java. The Matrix.java file: [Matrix.java](MatrixJava/exercise/Matrix.java)

The operation includes: matrix addition and subtraction, matrix product, computation of determinant, QR decomposition, eigenvalue calculation, etc. 

I also wrote a few exceptions that extends RuntimeException, which are throwed when the matrix don't meet the opeation requirement.

If I have time in the future, I will optimize some of the methods or add new operations.
